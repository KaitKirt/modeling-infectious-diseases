# ðŸ¦  SIR Model Simulation in MATLAB

This project explores **epidemiological modeling** using **discrete-time SIR models** in MATLAB. It simulates how diseases spread through populations under varying assumptions, including total population changes and loss of immunity.

## ðŸ”¬ Whatâ€™s Inside

- **Part 1 â€“ Basic SIR Model**  
  Models the spread of a disease in a closed population using constant parameters.
  
- **Part 2 â€“ Variable Population SIR Model**  
  Includes births, deaths, and infection-related mortality in the total population over time.

- **Part 3 â€“ Immunity Loss SIR Model**  
  Adds the possibility of losing immunity, where recovered individuals may return to the susceptible group.

## ðŸ“ˆ Features

- Discrete updates using custom functions (no built-in solvers)
- Multi-part plotting with `plot()` and `linspace()`
- Variable control of transmission (`Î±`), recovery (`Î²`), death (`Î³`), birth/death (`Î¼`), and immunity loss (`Ï‰`)
- Visualizations:  
  - Time evolution of susceptible, infected, recovered, and total populations  
  - Phase plot: Infected vs. Susceptible

## ðŸ§ª Topics Covered

- SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) modeling
- Epidemiology & population dynamics
- Discrete equation modeling
- Immunity waning models
- Parameter sensitivity
